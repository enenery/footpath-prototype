# footpath-prototype
Initial Simulation Experiment Plan

The purpose of our experiment is to compare the localization accuracy of FootPath and FootPath + Vista (only equipped on one side) + Particle Filter algorithm.

There are following map & user behavior variations:

User’s walk behavior types: 
1. User follows the expected path more or less 
2. User strays from the expected path

User’s path types: 
1. The expected path is straight (not involving any turns) 
2. The expected path involves turns

Wall types: 
1. The wall contains closed doors 
2. The wall contains open doors
3. The wall doesn’t contain doors 

To consider all combination of above cases, we have 12 test cases.
